# Feature Specification: Google Gemini Nano Multi-Image Analysis Project

**Feature Branch**: `001-2025-9-google`  
**Created**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "현재 2025년 9월 기준으로 가장 최신의 google의 nano banana api를 사용하여 여러개의 이미지 input과 프롬프트를 통해 결과를 받아볼수 있는 프로젝트를 만들고 싶음,"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Extracted: Multi-image processing with Google Gemini Nano API and prompt-based analysis
2. Extract key concepts from description  
   → Actors: Users, System, Google Gemini Nano API
   → Actions: Upload multiple images, provide prompts, receive analysis results
   → Data: Images, text prompts, API responses
   → Constraints: Latest API version as of September 2025
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Maximum number of images per request]
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Supported image formats and size limits]
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Authentication and API key requirements]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Primary flow: Upload images + prompt → Get analysis results
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Image upload, prompt input, API integration, result display
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Image, Prompt, Analysis Result, API Request
7. Run Review Checklist
   → WARN "Spec has uncertainties - marked for clarification"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications needed)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users want to analyze multiple images simultaneously using Google's latest Gemini Nano AI model by providing custom prompts to get contextual insights about the visual content.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has multiple images to analyze, **When** they upload the images and provide a descriptive prompt, **Then** the system returns AI-generated analysis results for all images
2. **Given** a user provides a comparative prompt, **When** they upload multiple related images, **Then** the system provides comparative analysis highlighting differences and similarities
3. **Given** a user uploads images with a specific question prompt, **When** the analysis is complete, **Then** the results directly address the prompt's intent

### Edge Cases
- What happens when uploaded images exceed size or format limits?
- How does the system handle API rate limiting or temporary service unavailability?
- What occurs when the prompt is empty or contains inappropriate content?
- How are partial failures handled when some images process successfully but others fail?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to upload multiple images simultaneously
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept text prompts to guide image analysis  
- **FR-003**: System MUST integrate with the latest Google Gemini Nano API as of September 2025
- **FR-004**: System MUST display analysis results in a readable format
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle API authentication securely
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate image formats and sizes before processing
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide error handling for failed API requests
- **FR-008**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum number of images per analysis request not specified]
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: supported image formats not specified - JPEG, PNG, WebP, etc.?]
- **FR-010**: Users MUST be able to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: save, export, or share analysis results - behavior not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Image**: Visual content uploaded by users with metadata like filename, size, format
- **Prompt**: Text instruction provided by users to guide AI analysis
- **Analysis Result**: AI-generated response containing insights about the images
- **API Request**: Structured request to Google Gemini Nano containing images and prompts
- **User Session**: Context maintaining uploaded images and prompts during analysis workflow
